Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up? 
My name is Kathryn Lesko, I'm a personal trainer and crossfit coach at the North oakland YMCA crossfit. I grew up in Stockbridge mi.  

Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
i don't think I was really active. I never played sports I wanted to but never got the support from my parents to do so. However I did ride my bike a lot and hike in our woods but that's about it. 
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
i got introduced in 2011 while I was an intern at the north Oakland YMCA. I was hooked immediately. 
 
Q: You recently got married, and had a baby. Did you slow down during this time, and if so, was it difficult having to do so?
My marriage didn't slow me down, actually my husband was a great support in helping me stay active while I was pregnant , well as much as I could. During my pregnancy I had really bad morning sickness, this interfered with all my training. It took everything I had just to make it to work.... I was not consuming enough calories so my focus was on trying to make sure the first trimester was ok for the baby in the form of not over exerting myself. Once I started feeling better in the second trimester the morning sickness took its toll. I had lost a lot of muscle mass and endurance, so slowing down was hard, and even harder in the third trimester when I could only talk about the stuff I use to be able to do. But I kept my focus on my pregnancy. I had been waiting 13 years for it.  

Q: What is your role at North Oakland YMCA CrossFit?
I am one of the head trainers. I meet with potential new members and make the decision what would be appropriate for them to start at for their fitness level
 
Q: Is CrossFit open to anyone? Do they have to be fit to start? Why? 
Crossfit is open to anyone and everyone. No you do not need to be "fit" to start, just willing to take direction and start where you are and be willing to get uncomfortable! If you say I'm going to wait till I'm in shape for  crossfit, let me tell you,  you will always e waiting till your fit enough. Your never really ready for crossfit until you do crossfit. There is just nothing else out there that will get you the same results. 
 
Q: With a teenager and a new baby, how do you manage your schedule? 
Lol, my husband is a blessing. He really does help out with the baby. And my teen, well she does everything I do. We defiantly work as a family unit and we all pitch in. We also work out together (minus the baby .... for now ) Crossfit fits into my schedule because I only need an hour. To be honest I don't get to work out as much as I use to but 5, one hour a week classes works so much better than anything that I ever use to do.
 
Q: Has it been challenging to get back in to shape after the birth?
Yes I still think I can do the workout the same way I use to. I know I am hard on myself and my expectations are high for my return, that's why I love my group so much. They know not to push me, hey I'm competitive so they don't challenge me they help me see how far I have come in the weeks after having my baby. I also have to worry about milk supply. As a trainer I get looked at physically, it's my job really I get judged every day, I am still hillsong onto about 10-15# but I can not cut body fat or push to hard or my milk supply goes down. I also have to watch my calories. If I do  a Wod I increase my calorie intake by about 500 calories. I'd love to cut my body fat quicker but milk is more important. I am however happy wi my strength gains, 12 weeks post and I am about 80% back to the weights I was lifting.
