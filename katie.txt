Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up? 
My name is Kathryn Lesko, I'm a personal trainer and crossfit coach at the North oakland YMCA crossfit. I grew up in Stockbridge mi.  

Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
i don't think I was really active. I never played sports I wanted to but never got the support from my parents to do so. However I did ride my bike a lot and hike in our woods but that's about it. 
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
i got introduced in 2011 while I was an intern at the north Oakland YMCA. I was hooked immediately. 
 
Q: You recently got married, and had a baby. Did you slow down during this time, and if so, was it difficult having to do so?
My marriage didn't slow me down, actually my husband was a great support in helping me stay active while I was pregnant , well as much as I could. During my pregnancy I had really bad morning sickness, this interfered with all my training. It took everything I had just to make it to work.... I was not consuming enough calories so my focus was on trying to make sure the first trimester was ok for the baby in the form of not over exerting myself. Once I started feeling better in the second trimester the morning sickness took its toll. I had lost a lot of muscle mass and endurance, so slowing down was hard, and even harder in the third trimester when I could only talk about the stuff I use to be able to do. But I kept my focus on my pregnancy. I had been waiting 13 years for it.
