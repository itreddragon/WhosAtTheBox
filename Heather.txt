Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up?
I am Heather Dunn and I grew up in Novi, MI.
 
Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
I would say when I was a pre-teen I was active just doing neighborhood things like bike riding, playing baseball and football, roller skating, and walking to/from school and everywhere.  We were outside everyday playing some sort of sport or game.  Once I hit my teens my activity around the neighborhood decreased. In middle school and high school I wasn’t as active, but I did participate in ski club and played softball.   
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
I was introduced to Crossfit by Glenn’s sister, Christina.  She had been doing Crossfit for a few years while living in the U.P. and was looking for a local box.  She had tried a few and really liked Five Lakes.  She talked Glenn and I into purchasing a Groupon to do the Group On Ramp in October of 2015.  I decided that I would do it just to get Glenn acclimated and then after the month I would quit.  I was so nervous and remember wanting to back out the first night because I knew I was so out of shape and didn’t want to look silly.  The first week I realized just how right I was that I was out of shape, but amazingly I didn’t feel silly about going.  Although there were so many people who were better than I was, the coaches and the athletes were so supportive, that all the things I was nervous about just faded away.  I ended up enjoying the workouts, enjoyed the pain my body was experiencing and looked forward to learning new movements each class. Once the On Ramp was over, it didn’t take much convincing to get me to sign up.  I’ve been loving it ever since.
            
Q: What did you want to be when you grew up? Or, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Growing up I wanted to be a cashier at the grocery store.  Before scanners, they would have to type in each item, and I just was amazed at how fast they could do it.  I would tell my mom I was going to work at Farmer Jack and be the fastest checkout there.  Unfortunately, technology stole that dream away….
