Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up? 
Hi! I’m Jessica Christie. I’m 24 years old, and will be 25 in September. I grew up right here in Farmington Hills, Michigan. I currently live in my childhood home with my parents, my twin brother, and my crazy dog! I went away to college in Holland, Michigan, but came back when I finished my exercise science degree. I’m currently working the 5am shift at Trader Joe’s. It’s a job I really enjoy and keeps me active all day long. In the evenings of my day I spend it working out, or the occasional coaching right here at the box! My free time is spent with my family, my boyfriend, or my friends! I’m also a huge relaxer, and really value a nap and a good sudoku puzzle.
 
Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
I definitely was. When I was younger, my mom had me try almost every sport. I was on t-ball and soccer teams for a couple years, but didn’t show much potential there. When I was six, my mom sent my brother and I to a gymnastics birthday party, and I loved it. My mom tried to get me to start lessons, but I was always too scared to go. I finally started gymnastics when I was seven, and did the sport until the end of high school. In the gymnastics world, I was not a good gymnast, but I was hardworking and very strong. It became my obsession, and pretty much took all my free time. Competitive gymnastics is year-round, and felt like a full-time job at the time! During the school year we worked out 24 hours a week, not including travel competitions on the weekends. In the summer, we’d train almost 40 hours a week, including 2-a-day training. Needless to say, I feel like I grew up in the gym.
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
I grew up and did gymnastics with coach Ali :) We were inseparable as kids! We kept in touch when I went away to college, and when I came home for breaks we’d always grab lunch. She started telling me about her Crossfit journey and expressed interest in opening a gym. Ali was convinced I’d love it but I felt I wouldn’t be good at the sport. I barely worked out in college and was completely out of shape. Five Lakes opened in November 2014, and I was their 7th founding member. I’ve fallen in love with this sport and haven’t looked back since!
 
Q: Not that you are old, but what do you miss most about being a kid?
I think most adults would agree that lack of financial responsibility is something desired about their childhood! Also, my grandparents had a Florida home, and we’d typically go there every winter. I have some wonderful memories of my grandfather and I just remember feeling so happy there with my whole family. Overall, I had such a good childhood, but I did suffer from childhood migraines from third grade to end of high school. I’d typically get them 2-4 times a week, and were so debilitating that once i got one I was useless for the rest of the day. Reflecting on it, I’d take being an adult over a kid any day!

Q: What do you see as your future in CrossFit?
I’m not entirely sure, to be honest! I know that I want to be the best athlete I can possibly be, and I want the journey to be a long one. My constant focus is showing up to class and to get a little better every day. I’m incredibly competitive with myself, so I’m always striving to get a PR on a lift or a better time on a WOD. At the beginning of the last two years, I’ve written down numbers on all my lifts that I want to hit before the year is over. I’d love to see where this sport takes me. Longevity is really what’s important to me. I want remain in shape and exercising for the rest of my life, ideally.
As far as coaching goes, I’m so excited to do more of it! As a coach, I’m focusing on developing a sharper eye for small details and building my confidence.
 
Q: This question might crossover with the one above, but do you see yourself moving in to a field that complements your degree, or do you have other future plans?
That’s a good question, and it’s one that brings me a lot of stress! Haha. I’m really happy with where I am right now, so I don’t feel obligated to change anything just yet. It’s all kind of a big question mark for me. Maybe one day I’ll go back to school, or maybe I’ll find myself coaching CrossFit full-time. I’ll figure it out one day, but for now I’m just taking it day by day :)
 
Q: How does your family, and boyfriend, feel about your CrossFit life?
My parents are and always have been incredibly supportive of everything I’ve done. I could place last at a competition and they’d still greet me with a smile and tell me how well I did. That’s just the kind of people they are. They’re happy because they know how happy the sport makes me. My brothers probably don’t think much of my CrossFit life since I grew up as the athlete in the family.

My boyfriend is very supportive as well. He probably thinks I talk about it too much, but always listens when I tell him about a tough WOD, or is proud of me when I tell him about a great day in the gym. I’m really a lucky girl.

Q: How would you go about convincing someone to give CrossFit a try?
I always start by telling people that everything is CrossFit is scaleable, and you don’t need to be “fit” to start the sport. There are coaches to guide you and encourage safe and efficient movement. CrossFit teaches body awareness, mental toughness, and the power of community building. It’s not hard to sell the sport when you feel so strongly about it. The hardest part I have convincing people about is the price. We as CrossFitters know it’s more than worth it, but telling that to someone who pays a $10 gym membership fee is much trickier. I’m still working on my inner saleswoman :)
