Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up?
My name is Brian, I'm 26 and married with 2 little girls. I grew up in Queen Creek, AZ and partly Provo, UT.
 
Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
Growing up I was pretty active. I loved riding bikes and playing football in the park until I found my first love skateboarding. I skated from age 7-15. Once I got into highschool I started playing team sports and ended up focusing mostly on Football and Wrestling.
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
I got into CrossFit in late 2012. I was stuck at a dead end desk job and stubbles across videos of the 2012 CrossFit Games. After watching a few videos I was hooked. Since being home from my Mission and being recently married I had kinda let myself go and weighed about 250 (I now weigh 210# and dropping). CrossFit re-ignited my for to better myself and attack my dreams.
 
Q: What is your role at your affiliate?
My role at our box is mostly coach. I do not have an official title but it ranges from manager, social media "dude", janitor and coach. 
We moved our family from Queen Creek, where I was coaching at a gym, to Provo specifically for Generator CrossFit. My role is to help the gym anyway that I can and do the things our owners don't have time to do so that our community can thrive.
