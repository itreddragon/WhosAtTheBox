Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up?
A: Hi! I'm Ali VanValkenburg. I'm a wife, dog mama to my beautiful Stanley, coach, and athlete. I'm loud, blunt, and sarcastic. I like to believe I'm becoming more patient, and mindful as I age. I grew up in Farmington Hills, and recently moved back into the house I grew up in.
 
Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
A: I was always active growing up. I started gymnastics at a young age, and started competing at the age of 10. Once I started competing, I was training between 20-25 hours per week. Once I decided I was finished being a competitive gymnast at 16, I took up diving, which I did for two years until the end of high school.
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
A: I first saw CrossFit on TV in the summer of 2012. It was the final day of the CrossFit competition, final women's heat, and I was astounded by how strong these women were. They were throwing around weight I couldn't imagine, with movements I had never seen before. Later that year, I bought a Groupon for CrossFit, and was too scared to go. It took me 6 months to finally head into the box with a friend, and I haven't looked back since. I started in March of 2013, and was L1 Certified by November.
 
Q: What is your favorite competition memory?
A: Gosh, this is hard to answer. Up until late last year, I really hadn't competed much. I wouldn't consider myself a "competitive" person. I like to believe that all I can do is my best, regardless of how that compares to others. With that being said, once we qualified for the Granite Games last year, I found myself in the scary position of not only competing on a high-level platform, but with a team. Since gymnastics isn't a team sport, I had never competed on a team. That was the most difficult part; I didn't want to let everyone down. But, there's not a more supportive, loving group of friends that I could imagine competing with. Without Liz, James and Nic, I would have never dreamed of competing in such a large competition. That weekend was definitely filled with lots of great memories, both on and off the competition floor. 

Q: Has your “loud, blunt,,sarcastic” style scared anyone off?
A: I like to think not (but you'd have to ask our members)! I understand that not everyone reacts well to my directness, so I do my best to read each athlete, and know whether or not a direct cue will help them succeed. I often have athletes thank me for giving them the "push" they needed. 
 
Q: When you stopped competing at gymnastics, did you have any challenges with the amount of time you suddenly opened up?
A: Definitely. When you're so involved in one sport for your lifetime, there's an identity crisis that comes with a sudden stop. Starting to dive helped, since I spent time training in a different atmosphere. Thankfully, my transition came at a time where I was able to drive, so I was able to go on adventures with my friends that I wouldn't have had time for beforehand. I also had the freedom to get where I wanted to go, and parents who were very trusting. Shortly after I quit, I also started dating Justin, so that took up a chunk of time as well.
 
Q: Is it a challenge having your husband work out at the box, particularly when you are coaching?
A: He's probably the better person to ask! He's one of the most naturally athletic people I've ever met. He picks up sports and movements quickly, which is something I'm unfamiliar with. So, I think the most challenging part is allowing him time to make corrections. I know that he's capable of making them, but I expect them to happen right away. I fully admit that I'm impatient with high expectations, which is my issue, not his!
 
Q: You’ve had your L1 Cert for some time. Do you have any other coaching certifications, and do you plan on adding any?
A: In addition to my L1, I have my CrossFit mobility cert, CrossFit Scaling cert, TacFit and FlowFit. Two of the certifications I'm most interested in currently are the CrossFit Powerlifting, and Aerobic Capacity certifications. I believe the powerlifting certification done at Conjugate would be a blast, because they have a lot of specialized equipment that would be fun to understand, as well as why it helps athletes improve. The aerobic capacity interests me, because the more I discover as a coach, the more I realize I don't know. For example, people have issues with running mechanics, and I don't have the knowledge to help athletes fix their gate. Improving my knowledge of correct running strides, and theories behind increasing aerobic capacity would be beneficial to runners, and non-runners alike.

Q: Have you had any limiting injuries, and how have you dealt with them?
A: I am thankful to have not had any serious, acute injuries. However, I would say my hyper extensive elbows are a chronic injury, that I have to rehab and assess constantly. I'm limited to the amount of overhead squat work that I do, because I experience pain specifically in my right elbow. I have been doing more accessory work to strengthen the joint, as well as the surrounding muscles. I can say that my elbows are constantly improving, but I don't believe I'll see the day where I overhead squat pain free. 

Q: Have you ever come across people who you cannot train for some reason?
A: Thankfully no! There are always some athletes that are resistant to coaches, for whatever reason. I've been in that situation before, where I feel like I'm giving cues to athletes who don't trust me, so they don't make the correction. It takes a lot of patience to keep chipping away at these athletes and build their trust. 
 
Q: You have been labeled as the nutrition guru in the box. Is this something you have studied, or is this more of an informal knowledge gathering?
A: Most of my nutritional knowledge is based on my own experiences. A lot of trial and error. I've worked with two different companies, RP Strength and Working Against Gravity, and learned from both. I'm constantly experimenting with my own eating patterns to find what works for my body, and I'm happy to share my findings with anyone. 
 
Q: What is the simplest advice you can give to those of us who are nutrionally challenged?
A: Play with your nutrition! You have to find what works best for you, and your body. Some people respond well to very specific, regimented plans. Other people need variety and options. I'm the type of person who can eat the same food day in and day out, keeping with my schedule. Just because it works for me, doesn't mean it will work for everyone. So experiment, and enjoy!
 
Q: Have you always had a dog, or other pets?
A: Growing up, we always had dogs (at least one, if not two). I also had a variety of rodents, with rats being my favorite. It sounds odd, but they're the most snuggly and well mannered!
