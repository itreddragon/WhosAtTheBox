Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up?
A: Hi! I'm Ali VanValkenburg. I'm a wife, dog mama to my beautiful Stanley, coach, and athlete. I'm loud, blunt, and sarcastic. I like to believe I'm becoming more patient, and mindful as I age. I grew up in Farmington Hills, and recently moved back into the house I grew up in.
 
Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
A: I was always active growing up. I started gymnastics at a young age, and started competing at the age of 10. Once I started competing, I was training between 20-25 hours per week. Once I decided I was finished being a competitive gymnast at 16, I took up diving, which I did for two years until the end of high school.
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
A: I first saw CrossFit on TV in the summer of 2012. It was the final day of the CrossFit competition, final women's heat, and I was astounded by how strong these women were. They were throwing around weight I couldn't imagine, with movements I had never seen before. Later that year, I bought a Groupon for CrossFit, and was too scared to go. It took me 6 months to finally head into the box with a friend, and I haven't looked back since. I started in March of 2013, and was L1 Certified by November.
 
Q: What is your favorite competition memory?
A: Gosh, this is hard to answer. Up until late last year, I really hadn't competed much. I wouldn't consider myself a "competitive" person. I like to believe that all I can do is my best, regardless of how that compares to others. With that being said, once we qualified for the Granite Games last year, I found myself in the scary position of not only competing on a high-level platform, but with a team. Since gymnastics isn't a team sport, I had never competed on a team. That was the most difficult part; I didn't want to let everyone down. But, there's not a more supportive, loving group of friends that I could imagine competing with. Without Liz, James and Nic, I would have never dreamed of competing in such a large competition. That weekend was definitely filled with lots of great memories, both on and off the competition floor.
