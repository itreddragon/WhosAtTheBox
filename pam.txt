Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up?
Hi! I'm Pam VanValkenburg. I grew up in Southfield, and attended Birmingham Groves High School. I went to Oakland University, where I met my husband, Jim, and I eventually went on to receive my Masters from The University of Michigan. Though I received my degrees, I did not work long in my field of Industrial Hygiene, as I elected to be a stay at home mom.  I currently work part time within the Farmington Public Schools.  I've been married 29 years and have 2 boys, Justin, who is married to Coach Ali, and Jared, who will be leaving for the Air Force in October.

 
Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
  I was very active growing up!  I was always playing pick up games of basketball, football, and baseball with the boys in the neighborhood.  As a youth, I played on the first organized girls baseball team in Michigan. I also played basketball for the Parks and Rec League, and then in middle school and high school.  I also got into soccer when I was in high school, and ended up playing for Oakland University's first women's club soccer team.

After having kids, I tried different exercise programs such as kick boxing, aerobics, and Jazzercise, but nothing held my interest.

Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
Jim and I started CrossFit in October 2015.  I should have started when they first opened, but I was intimidated and made a lot of excuses. I finally had enough of not feeling well, and decided to give it a try, plus I wanted to support Ali and Justin by joining Five Lakes. I had never lifted heavy weights before, but I really liked it. I found the workouts really tough, but I felt great, and had a lot more confidence.  I try to go 3 to 4 times a week.  It's really been the best thing I have done for myself!
 
Q: The Powerball lottery is up to $700M tonight. What would you do if you won it?
Wow, that would have been nice!  If I would win the Powerball, I would probably sell our house, make sure our kids are taken care of, give some to our brothers and their families, and of course, take care of our moms. I would buy another house in the area, but would also look at buying some vacation property. Travel would be nice, and I would also give to charity.
