Q: Who are you? Where did you grow up? 
My name is Steve Chang. My parents are from Taiwan, I was born in West Virginia, and I grew up in Canton, Michigan. My wife Courtney and I have two kids, Braxton and Alexandria. I've been a financial advisor at Edward Jones Investments going on fifteen years.  
 
Q: Were you active growing up, and if so how?
I never played any organized team sports when I was younger but I would say I was an active kid, running and riding my bike everywhere. I loved basketball in middle school but never made the team so I moved on to track for one year competing in the 800m run. 
 
The early days in my financial advising career was hard. I needed an outlet or something to do after work that I felt was going to be harder than my job. So, in 2005 I signed up for my very first race, the Detroit Marathon. All 26.2 miles! I probably should have started with a 5k but my attitude back then was go big or go home. Since then, I've completed a total of five full marathons, a handful of half-marathons and countless 5 and 10k's.  
 
Q: When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
I actually met James and Bruce at a chamber of commerce event at Drakeshire Lanes on June 4, 2015. I remember the date because it was my birthday. I mentioned to James that I wanted to try CrossFit after training for and running the Detroit Marathon in October. I had it in my mind that I would try CrossFit until the end of the year and then move onto something else as I usually did with any gym memberships. 
Q: What is the best advice you received from your parents?
I constantly hear from my mom - especially now that I'm 40 - to take care of myself. As she says, without your health you have nothing. Her health "tips" range from getting more sleep to limiting cell phone usage. She may be on to something as she moves around better than me! I know we always say we don't want to become our parents, but I already am with our kids.
