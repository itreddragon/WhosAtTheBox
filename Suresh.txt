Q: Introduce Yourself. Who is Suresh?
For people who don’t me, I am Sureshbabbu Balakrishnan, born and bought up in Tamil Nadu, India, married to a princess named Divya, have two kids Ashwin(9) and Dhanvin (5). I am a laid back, easy going person(at least this is what I think), who doesn't like to sweat on the small stuff. He likes to work on important things and put the small stuff in the back burner. You could see him relaxing in a couch and watch random videos in YouTube. He sometimes thinks too much and makes the simple things complicated. Like all forgetful men, he cannot remember where he placed his car key, books etc. and will search for it for hours. He places his things so secretly that only his wife could find them. He is an Engineer, a MBA graduate and works at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan as a Health Care Analyst. 
 
Q: Were you active growing up?
I was fairly active growing up, used to be out and play lots of games most of the time. In my Home country specifically where we grew up, there was kind of seasons for each activity Kite Fighting, 7 stones/Lagori, Koli Kundu(I have no idea what is the English translation), these games still interests me a lot but they are no longer played as we have become more and more sophisticated and moved to video games. In my school, apart from Cricket, had a huge liking towards Basketball and Volleyball. I still continue to keep up with Cricket and Volleyball. 
 
I have never been to a gym on a consistent basis. When I was 22, got some motivation from my friend and we joined a gym in Chennai, India. The best thing I could remember is the work outs we did on Fridays which includes biceps, triceps and forearm, so that we could flaunt them during the weekend. We always skipped the leg days.  Moved to Jacksonville, Florida when I was 24, my weekdays and weekends were packed with things to do, which included running in the treadmill, volleyball, cricket, clubbing etc. I will never forget those days and will remain as memories.
 
Q: How did you started with CrossFit?
I heard about CrossFit 3 and half year ago through my friend. Ever since he joined CrossFit, he has been gung-ho about it but the issue I had was the cost. I constantly ask the question is it worth the money? I said "No" many times to that question and carried on merrily doing it in my own dumb way, which is do the same routine in my basement for 30-40 mins without seeing much benefits. 
 
It was in January 2016, I decided to give it a try and was specifically looking for boxes which gave a discount for trying it out. My friend wanted me to come to Novi but it is a 15 min drive from home and i didn't want to drive 15 minutes up and down. I found a groupon for a place named "Five Lakes CrossFit", which was closer to my home, thought will give it a try. Got the Groupon and gave a call but went to voicemail. I got a call back from Bruce(I think) and he said there is ON Ramp next week and could come in and sign up. 
 
I still wasn't sure if this would work because I always had this mental model of huge guys working out lifting crazy weight and showing off their body at the gym. Within few days of On Ramp those Mental models were broken and was feeling relaxed. Quickly learned that the comparison is between the "You from Yesterday" to "You from Today". Some how I got hooked on to it and I am loving it.

Q: What brought you to the U.S.?
Money to be short and precise. I came here following all the other millions of immigrants aspiring to make it big. Came to the US back in July 2003, worked for Prudential Financial in Jacksonville, FL for close to 5 years. Loved it there and why did I ever move to Michigan? May be because of the Blues or may be not. This is a question that comes up to if not daily but at least once a week. I am trying to find an answer for that question, I will keep you posted as soon as I find the answer. 
 
Q: You like the early morning class. Why is that?
Having two kids, I found that evenings are not an ideal time because we have to constantly fiddle with kids schedule. Secondly, by the time I come home after work, I just want to rest if I have some time, I don't have the energy to do anything else. During Summers, I do have cricket for couple of days in the evening, I want to accommodate that as well and early morning class is an ideal fit for me. Early in the morning no one is awake, I have an hour and half to myself where I can work to get better day by day. We are made for each other at this time. 
 
Q: I heard a rumor recently that you signed up for your first competition. How did that decision come about, and how do you feel about it?
Yes, I have signed up for Rookie Rumble. Me and My friend Karthik, who works out at another CrossFit are partnering as Rookies for this competition. This would be my first competition aside CrossFit open. I have been thinking about competitions for some time and was looking for a competition that will be challenging but not be too intense.  Ideally I would have participated individually at the July 29th but the spots filled before I could register and that made me sign up for the next competition. Our team name is "Soppana Sundari", Do come and root for us, looking forward to seeing you all at the Plymouth CrossFit. I have mixed feelings, there are some butterflies flying in my stomach but as soon as the WOD's are released, will be working on it during the upcoming days.

Q: If you want us to come cheer you on, you need to tell us the date!
Mark your calendars the date is September 23rd. Looking forward to see some folks around.
 
Q: What's you least favorite mode of transportation?
I hate my drives to work, it sucks up almost 2 hours of my life daily. It is sad to say that because this is giving me my daily bread and butter but it adds so much stress and I would be happy if my office shifts to a closer location.

Q: Another cricketer! Must be an Indian thing. Have you noticed any changes to your performances in that sport since taking up CrossFit? Also, for those of us that know the sport, tell us if you are a batsman, bowler, all-rounder?
I would say almost 80% of Indian men are cricketers and I am one among the majority. If you ask what I am good at, I would say that I am an all rounder, which means that I bowl, bat and act as a wicketkeeper as well. I have noticed lots of changes since joining Crossfit. I used to have shoulder pains and I could hardly bowl or throw from the deep areas of the field. My shoulders have become stronger and therefore I am able to field/bowl better. I am still cautious but I am hoping for the best. While batting I have noticed that there is a lot more power in my shots and able to hit the balls farther and harder. Using the hips for generating power is another area which I believe has helped in my batting. Overall my stamina and strength has improved over the past year and I would credit the programming and the coaches for the improvements that I see in the game.
 
Q: So you have a couple of hours in the car each day. What do you do with that time?
 Drive. I try my best not to text and drive. I have succeeded to a fair extend but would like to completely avoid it. Other than that I would try to think about the work ahead. I sometimes talk to my friends about their workout, activities etc.

Q: Do you do anything to get your kids active, or are they doing that on their own?
I rarely engage with my kids activities. I take them to swimming, Taekwondo, Guitar classes etc. sometimes play with them touch football, soccer, basketball and cricket. 

I just purchased a trampoline and I hope that we can spend some time jumping together as a family. Spending time is with them is something I am going to focus on during the upcoming days. I have been running so fast focusing on things that are not important in life. I have to stop for a moment and start to focus on the kids and family.
