Q:  Who are you?  Where did you grow up? 
A:  Who I am currently is a loaded question, one with many facets to arrive at a reasonable answer.  The year was 1976 when my parents assigned me the social handle of Todd (Todd’s with two d’s, I’ve been told, are twice as much fun; I guess that’s up for review), making me just over 41.  My birth solidified the position of youngest, the elder two being females of our species.  I currently reside in Parkland WA, a small community minutes south of Tacoma, which is also where I spent the majority of my formative years.  Together with my wife of 15 years, Jocelyn, we manage to direct a family of 6 – a girl, and three boys between us.

Q:  Were you active growing up, and if so how?
A:  I’m hyperactive by nature (A.D.H.D you understand), which led my parents and family to find things which would tire me out.  I recall this starting with my father, who would take me on long runs when I was a child, something I’ve kept with as the years tick by.  I played baseball and soccer up until maybe 12 years of age.  In intermediate school as I kept with running, track interested me, and into high school I dabbled in cross country, before pulling that rip-cord and scattering into the wind.  I’ve always been busy, fidgety if you know what I mean, not that leg pumping and stirring when others sit quietly is any kind of activity.  Having a motor that is always at full tilt, I found myself on the go most the time, running the neighborhood or busy on my bicycle, and there was always a sizable trampoline around after my 14th summer.

Q:  When did you get in to CrossFit, and how?
A:  I’ve been at it now for over 5 years.  I could go on for days about this aspect, but I’ll try to condense it.  I love beer, and with that often comes friends who share the same feelings.  Sometimes, as in my case, one can become lost in a daily ritual which involves spending time with those friends and consuming that which we hold so dear, so much in fact that one can easily lose sight of things which are of most importance.  This abuse went on for a long while, so my wife went and found things more productive to do with her time while I was riding a barstool.  She started a Zumba class, which led her to a small backroom where the sounds of clanking steel peaked her interest, back where they did the CrossFitting.  Before long she was slipping me subtle hints about what she was experiencing, not pressing me exactly, but always keeping the door open for me to come see.  As I watched her physique change, my interest grew.  One night, after another episode of argue with drinking Todd aired, we arrived at an impasse… the result would be my salvation.  Days later I gathered my courage, and followed her into the temple which would ultimately become so much more than just a gym.

Q:  As you were suggested by a previous interviewee – Kat – tell us how you know her, and if she was always this “enthusiastic”?
A:  I met Kat at the CrossFit I mentioned above, our slice of heaven - CrossFit 138.  She’s a firecracker alright, and always has that aspect waiting just below the surface.  When you share time with a culture and community of CrossFit, you begin to become family in many ways, crystalizing the realization of commonalities people share.  Kat and I share some personal struggles, which draws me to her for advice from time to time.  Sadly for me/us she left to challenge herself further, and has found what appears to be nearly the same caliber of family within your area.  We keep in touch, and it’s awesome to watch her grow…even from afar.  She is missed in our town, but with social media we manage to keep up with her shenanigans.
